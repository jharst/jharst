## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a comparative literature and media scholar at Saarland University. My involvemnet with GitHub revolves around the popular knowledge management app [Obsidian](http://obsidian.md). I'm using this app for note taking, class/curriculum development and presentations (via [Obsidian Advanced Slides](https://mszturc.github.io/obsidian-advanced-slides/)/[reveal.js](http://revealjs.com)). I'm also working on several plugins for Obsidian. My goal is to further connect my thoughts on knowledge management, media theory and coding practices.
